## Heap - Priority Queue
This program is to create a class called "heap" that provides programmers with the functionality of a priority queue using a binary heap implementation.

### Introduction 
Each item inserted into the binary heap will specify a unique string id, an integer key, and optionally any pointer. The implementation of the class should use pointers to void in order to handle pointers to any type of data. When a heap is declared, a capacity will be passed to its constructor representing the maximum number of items that may be in the heap at one time; the heap will never be allowed to grow past its initial capacity (although it is not difficult to implement a resize operation).
